# === Indicator Descriptions Glossary ===
INDICATOR_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "Uptrend (21>50>200 EMA)": {
        "description": "Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) smooth price data to identify trend direction. A bullish trend is indicated when shorter EMAs (e.g., 21-day) are above longer EMAs (e.g., 50-day), and both are above the longest EMA (e.g., 200-day).",
        "ideal": "21 EMA > 50 EMA > 200 EMA",
        "example": "If 21 EMA is $105, 50 EMA is $100, and 200 EMA is $95, this indicates a strong uptrend."
    },
    "Bullish PSAR": {
        "description": "Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR) is a time and price based trading system used to identify potential reversals in the price movement of traded assets. Bullish when dots are below price.",
        "ideal": "Dots below price",
        "example": "When the PSAR dots appear below the price candles, it suggests an ongoing or strengthening uptrend."
    },
    "Strong Trend (ADX > 25)": {
        "description": "The Average Directional Index (ADX) quantifies the strength of a trend. Values above 25 generally indicate a strong trend (either up or down), while values below 20 suggest a weak or non-trending market.",
        "ideal": "ADX > 25",
        "example": "An ADX reading of 35 suggests a strong trend is in place, regardless of direction."
    },
    "Bullish Momentum (RSI > 50)": {
        "description": "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements. An RSI above 50 generally suggests bullish momentum, while below 50 indicates bearish momentum. Overbought is typically above 70, oversold below 30.",
        "ideal": "RSI > 50 (for bullish momentum), ideally not overbought (>70)",
        "example": "An RSI of 60 indicates strong bullish momentum, while an RSI of 80 suggests the asset might be overbought and due for a pullback."
    },
    "Bullish Stoch Cross": {
        "description": "The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period. A bullish cross occurs when %K (fast line) crosses above %D (slow line), often below 50. Overbought is typically above 80, oversold below 20.",
        "ideal": "%K line crosses above %D (preferably below 50, but can signal continuation above 50)",
        "example": "If %K crosses above %D while both are below 50, it's a strong bullish signal from an oversold condition."
    },
    "Bullish CCI (>0)": {
        "description": "The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period. A CCI above zero generally indicates the price is above its average, suggesting an uptrend. Readings above +100 suggest strong uptrend, below -100 strong downtrend.",
        "ideal": "CCI > 0, ideally breaking above +100 for strong bullishness",
        "example": "A CCI moving from -50 to +70 indicates a shift to bullish momentum."
    },
    "Positive ROC (>0)": {
        "description": "Rate of Change (ROC) is a momentum indicator that measures the percentage change between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. A positive ROC indicates upward momentum.",
        "ideal": "ROC > 0",
        "example": "An ROC of +5% means the price is 5% higher than it was 'N' periods ago, indicating positive momentum."
    },
    "Volume Spike (>1.5x Avg)": {
        "description": "A volume spike indicates an unusual increase in trading activity, which often precedes or accompanies significant price movements. A volume greater than 1.5 times the average suggests strong interest.",
        "ideal": "Volume > 1.5x 50-day Average Volume (often confirms price moves)",
        "example": "A stock breaking out of resistance on a volume spike 2x its average volume confirms strong buying interest."
    },
    "OBV Rising": {
        "description": "On-Balance Volume (OBV) relates volume to price changes. A rising OBV indicates that positive volume pressure is increasing and confirms an uptrend. Divergences between OBV and price can signal reversals.",
        "ideal": "OBV is rising (higher than its recent average), confirming price uptrend",
        "example": "If price is making new highs and OBV is also making new highs, it confirms the strength of the uptrend."
    },
    "Price > VWAP": {
        "description": "Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark that represents the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. Price trading above VWAP is considered bullish.",
        "ideal": "Price > VWAP",
        "example": "If a stock opens below VWAP but then crosses above it, it often signals intraday strength."
    },
    "Bollinger Bands": {
        "description": "Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band (typically a 20-period Simple Moving Average) and two outer bands (typically two standard deviations above and below the middle band). They measure volatility and identify overbought/oversold conditions relative to the average price.",
        "ideal": "Price bouncing off lower band (bullish reversal), or price walking up the upper band (strong uptrend)",
        "example": "Price touching the lower band after a downtrend can signal a potential bounce. Price staying outside the upper band indicates strong momentum."
    },
    "Pivot Points": {
        "description": "Pivot Points are technical analysis indicators used to determine potential support and resistance levels based on the previous day's (or period's) high, low, and close prices. They are often used by intraday traders.",
        "ideal": "Price holding above Pivot Point (bullish), Price holding above R1 (very bullish), Price bouncing off S1/S2 (support)",
        "example": "If a stock opens above its daily Pivot Point and holds it, traders might look for a move towards R1."

        "ideal": "ITM (In-The-Money) for higher probability, ATM (At-The-Money) for balanced risk/reward, OTM (Out-of-The-Money) for higher leverage/lower cost.",
        "example": "If a stock is at $100, a $90 Call is ITM, a $100 Call is ATM, and a $110 Call is OTM."
    },
    "Expiration": {
        "description": "The date on which an option contract ceases to exist. After this date, the option can no longer be exercised.",

        "description": "The target price for the option to reach for a desired profit. This is often based on a reward-to-risk ratio.",
        "ideal": "At least 1:1 or 2:1 Reward/Risk ratio.",
        "example": "If your max risk is $200, a $400 profit target represents a 2:1 Reward/Risk."

    },
    "Delta": {
        "description": "Measures how much an option's price is expected to move for every $1 change in the underlying stock's price. Also represents the approximate probability of an option expiring in-the-money.",

    },
    "Theta": {
        "description": "Measures the rate at which an option's price decays over time (time decay). Theta is typically negative, meaning the option loses value as it approaches expiration.",
        "ideal": "As low as possible when buying options (less time decay), higher when selling options (more time decay works in your favor).",

    },
    "Gamma": {
        "description": "Measures the rate of change of an option's Delta. High Gamma means Delta will change rapidly as the stock price moves, leading to accelerated gains or losses.",
        "ideal": "Higher for directional plays (faster delta changes), lower for stability.",
        "example": "If Delta is 0.50 and Gamma is 0.05, a $1 stock move will increase Delta to 0.55."
    },
    "Vega": {
        "description": "Measures how much an option's price is expected to change for every 1% change in implied volatility. Options with higher Vega are more sensitive to changes in IV.",
        "ideal": "Lower if you expect IV to fall (for long options), higher if you expect IV to fall (for short options).",

    },
    "Rho": {
        "description": "Measures how much an option's price is expected to change for every 1% change in interest rates. This is typically less significant for short-term options.",

    },
    "Open Interest": {
        "description": "The total number of outstanding option contracts that have not yet been closed or exercised. A high number indicates good liquidity and market interest.",
